# Star-Project

### About
Star management program that takes information about star, checks whether they're correct and saves to file.
Program can add, delete and sort given stars by values

### The biggest challenge
Main difficulty was star property named Catalog Name. It checks star constellation and if there are any other stars in the same constellation it sorts them by brightness and assigns greek letters in descending progression. It's beeing updated each time when we add or delete star

### Purpose
Purpose of this project was to train object oriented programming, operation on files and writing tests
